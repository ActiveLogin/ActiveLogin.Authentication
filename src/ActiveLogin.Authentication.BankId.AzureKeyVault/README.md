# ActiveLogin.Authentication.BankId.AzureKeyVault

ActiveLogin.Authentication enables an application to support Swedish BankID (svenskt BankID) authentication in .NET.
Built on NET Standard and packaged as NuGet-packages they are easy to install and use on multiple platforms.

Free to use, [commercial support and training](https://activelogin.net/#support) is available if you need assistance or a quick start. 

## Sample usage

Sample usage of the extension method to use client certificates for BankID from Azure KeyVault.

Adds the `UseClientCertificateFromAzureKeyVault(...)` extension method.

```csharp
services
    .AddBankId(bankId =>
    {
        bankId.UseClientCertificateFromAzureKeyVault(Configuration.GetSection("ActiveLogin:BankId:ClientCertificate"));
    });
```

By default, the `DefaultAzureCredential` will be used as credentials. For info on how to use that, see [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential). The minimal configuration then looks like this:

```json
{
    "ActiveLogin:BankId:ClientCertificate" {
        "AzureKeyVaultUri": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE",
        "AzureKeyVaultSecretName": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE"
    }
}
```

You can override the specific managed identity client id to use:

```json
{
    "ActiveLogin:BankId:ClientCertificate" {
        "AzureKeyVaultUri": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE",
        "AzureKeyVaultSecretName": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE",

        "AzureManagedIdentityClientId": ""
    }
}
```

You can also override to use client credentials:

```json
{
    "ActiveLogin:BankId:ClientCertificate" {
        "AzureKeyVaultUri": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE",
        "AzureKeyVaultSecretName": "TODO-ADD-YOUR-VALUE",

        "AzureAdTenantId": "",
        "AzureAdClientId": "",
        "AzureAdClientSecret": ""
    }
}
```

They will be evaluated in the order:

1. `ClientSecretCredential` with `AzureAdTenantId` + `AzureAdClientId` + `AzureAdClientSecret` (if specified)
2. `DefaultAzureCredential` with `AzureManagedIdentityClientId` (if specified)
3. `DefaultAzureCredential`
