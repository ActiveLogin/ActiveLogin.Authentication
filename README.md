## Getting started

First of all, you need to decide if you want to use [native BankID](https://www.bankid.com/bankid-i-dina-tjanster/sa-kommer-du-igang) or BankID through [GrandID (Svensk E-identitet)](https://e-identitet.se/tjanster/inloggningsmetoder/bankid/).

* _Native BankID_ gives you full flexibility, including custom UI but requires issuing a certificate through a bank and usually takes some time to sort out.
* _GrandID (Svensk E-identitet)_ uses a predefined UI and does not support all functionalities of the BankID API, but is really easy to get started with and does not require any certificates.

_Screenshots on how the default UI for Native BankID looks._

### 1. Install the NuGet package

ActiveLogin.Authentication is distributed as [packages on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ActiveLogin), install using the tool of your choice, for example _dotnet cli_.

#### BankID

```powershell
dotnet add package ActiveLogin.Authentication.BankId.AspNetCore
```

#### GrandID

```powershell
dotnet add package ActiveLogin.Authentication.GrandId.AspNetCore
```

### 2. Prepare your project

It is expected that you have a basic understanding of how [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/), [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview) and [ASP.NET Core Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) works before getting started.

The authentication modules for BankID and GrandID are registered in `ConfigureServices( ... )` in your `Startup.cs`. Depending on your setup, you will probably have to configure challenge and callbacks in `AccountController.cs` or similar.

### 3. Get started in development

Both BankID and GrandID requires you to receive either certificates or API-keys, but to get started and try it out the experience there is a simulated environment options available that uses an in-memory implementation. Great for development and testing.

#### BankID

```c#
services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddBankId(builder =>
    {
        builder
            .UseSimulatedEnvironment()
            .AddSameDevice()
            .AddOtherDevice();
    });
```

#### GrandID

```c#
services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddGrandId(builder =>
    {
        builder
            .UseSimulatedEnvironment()
            .AddBankIdSameDevice(options => { })
            .AddBankIdOtherDevice(options => { });
    });
```

### 4. Use test or production environments

To authenticate using a real BankID you need to receive a certificate or API-keys, depending on what solution you choose. The details are described in these documents:

* [Getting started with BankID in Test and Production](docs/getting-started-bankid.md)
* [Getting started with GrandID in Test and Production](docs/getting-started-grandid-bankid.md)

Samples on how to use them in production are:

#### [BankID](docs/getting-started-bankid.md)

```c#
services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddBankId(builder =>
    {
        builder
            .UseProductionEnvironment()
            .UseClientCertificateFromAzureKeyVault(Configuration.GetSection("ActiveLogin:BankId:ClientCertificate"))
            .UseRootCaCertificate(Path.Combine(_environment.ContentRootPath, Configuration.GetValue<string>("ActiveLogin:BankId:CaCertificate:FilePath")))
            .AddSameDevice()
            .AddOtherDevice();
    });
```

#### [GrandID](docs/getting-started-grandid-bankid.md)

```c#
services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddGrandId(builder =>
    {
        builder
            .UseProductionEnvironment(config => {
	        config.ApiKey = Configuration.GetValue<string>("ActiveLogin:GrandId:ApiKey");
	        config.BankIdServiceKey = Configuration.GetValue<string>("ActiveLogin:GrandId:BankIdServiceKey");
            })
            .AddBankIdSameDevice()
            .AddBankIdOtherDevice();
    });
```

## Overriding partial views

ActiveLogin comes with predefined views that you can use, but maybe you'd rather use your own views to customize layout or behavior.
In your web project, create the following folder:
```Areas/BankIdAuthentication/Views/BankId```
In this folder, you can then create any of the partials and MVC will then discover your partials and use any of them before ours. It's still possible to call our partials if you still want to use them.

* `_Login.cshtml`
* `_LoginForm.cshtml`
* `_LoginScript.cshtml`
* `_LoginStatus.cshtml`

See [the MVC sample](https://github.com/ActiveLogin/ActiveLogin.Authentication/tree/master/samples/Standalone.MvcSample) to see this in action, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/ActiveLogin/ActiveLogin.Authentication/tree/master/samples/Standalone.MvcSample/Areas/BankIdAuthentication/Views/BankId/_Login.cshtml).

## FAQ

### Can I use Active Login from both .NET Core 2.2 and Core 3.0?

Yes you can! It targets .NET Standard 2.0 and is tested from applicationns running both ASP.NET COre 2.2 and ASP.NET Core 3.0.
Moving forward we will focus our efforts on Core 3.0. Samples of usage from Core 3.0 is available as a separate branch at the moment.

### How do I run the samples?

The samples are configured to run in simulated mode (no BankID certificates or GrandID keys required) by default. The _IdentityServer.ClientSample_ is using the _IdentityServer.ServerSample_ as its identity provider. So to run the _IdentityServer.ClientSample_, the _IdentityServer.ServerSample_ needs to be running first.

The easiest way to try the sample out is to:

1. Configure the solution to use _Multiple startup projects_, and set it to start both _IdentityServer.ServerSample_ and _IdentityServer.ClientSample_
1. Press F5

There is also a standalone sample called _Standalone.MvcSample_ which uses only AspNetCore MVC with minimum of code.

### Can I try out a live demo of the samples?

Yes! They are available here. Please note that IdentityServer.ClientSample uses IdentityServer.ServerSample as the IdentityProvider, so the IdentityServer.ClientSample is a good place to start.

* IdentityServer.ClientSample: [https://al-samples-mvcclient.azurewebsites.net](https://al-samples-mvcclient.azurewebsites.net)
* IdentityServer.ServerSample: [https://al-samples-identityserver.azurewebsites.net](https://al-samples-identityserver.azurewebsites.net)

### Can I prepopulate the personal identity number for the user?

Yes you can! If you provide an authentication property item named `swedishPersonalIdentityNumber` (available as constants `BankIdAuthenticationConstants.AuthenticationPropertyItemSwedishPersonalIdentityNumber` or `GrandIdAuthenticationConstants.AuthenticationPropertyItemSwedishPersonalIdentityNumber`) that value will be used and sent to BankID/GrandID.

_Example usage:_

```csharp
public IActionResult ExternalLogin(string provider, string returnUrl, string personalIdentityNumber)
{
    var props = new AuthenticationProperties
    {
        RedirectUri = Url.Action(nameof(ExternalLoginCallback)),
        Items =
        {
            {"returnUrl", returnUrl},
            {"scheme", provider},
            { BankIdAuthenticationConstants.AuthenticationPropertyItemSwedishPersonalIdentityNumber, personalIdentityNumber }
        }
    };

    return Challenge(props, provider);
}
```
### Do I need to use your ASP.NET Core Auth provider, or can just use the API?

No, it's optional :) We have seperated the API-wrappers for both BankID and GrandID into two separate packages so that you can use them in other scenarios we have not covered. The look like this and are both well documented using XML-comments.

#### ActiveLogin.Authentication.BankId.Api

```csharp
public class BankIdApiClient : IBankIdApiClient
{
    public Task<AuthResponse> AuthAsync(AuthRequest request) { ... }
    public Task<SignResponse> SignAsync(SignRequest request) { ... }
    public Task<CollectResponse> CollectAsync(CollectRequest request) { ... }
    public Task<CancelResponse> CancelAsync(CancelRequest request) { ... }
}
```

#### ActiveLogin.Authentication.GrandId.Api

```csharp
public class GrandIdApiClient : IGrandIdApiClient
{
    public async Task<BankIdFederatedLoginResponse> BankIdFederatedLoginAsync(BankIdFederatedLoginRequest request) { ... }
    public async Task<BankIdGetSessionResponse> BankIdGetSessionAsync(BankIdGetSessionRequest request) { ... }
    public async Task<LogoutResponse> LogoutAsync(LogoutRequest request) { ... }
}
```

### Why are the names sometimes capitalized?

It seems that the name for some persons are returned in all capitalized letters (like `ALICE SMITH`), the data is probably stored that way at BankID.
We have choosen not to normalize the capitalization of the names as it´s hard or impossible to do so in a general way.

### Can I use Active Login to get support for BankID or GrandID in Azure AD (Active Directory) B2C?

Yes you can! Azure AD B2C supports using cusotm identity providers that supports [Open ID Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/sv-se/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-oidc). If you deploy Active Login as part of Identity Server (see our samples) you can configure your Azure AD B2C to federate to that instance and by doing so get BankID and/or GrandID support.

## Active Login

_Integrating your systems with market leading authentication services._

Active Login is an Open Source project built on .NET Standard that makes it easy to integrate with leading Swedish authentication services like [BankID](https://www.bankid.com/).

It also provide examples of how to use it with the popular OpenID Connect & OAuth 2.0 Framework [IdentityServer](https://identityserver.io/) and provides a template for hosting the solution in Microsoft Azure.
In addition, Active Login also contain convenient modules that help you work with and handle validation of Swedish Personal Identity Number (svenskt personnummer).
